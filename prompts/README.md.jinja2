# PR Pilot Command-Line Interface

[PR Pilot](https://docs.pr-pilot.ai) gives you a natural language interface for your Github projects.
Given a prompt, it uses LLMs (Large Language Models) to autonomously fulfill tasks by interacting with your code base
and Github issues.

Using [prompt templates](./prompts), you can create powerful,
reusable commands that can be executed by PR Pilot.

## 🛠️ Usage

Open a terminal and `ls` into a repository you have [installed](https://github.com/apps/pr-pilot-ai/installations/new) PR Pilot.

In your repository, use the `pilot` command:

```bash
pilot task "Tell me about this project!"
```

**📝 Ask PR Pilot to edit a local file for you:**

```bash
pilot edit cli/cli.py "Make sure all functions and classes have docstrings."
```

**⚡ Generate code quickly and save it as a file:**

```bash
pilot task -o test_utils.py --code "Write some unit tests for the utils.py file."
```

**🔍 Capture part of your screen and add it to a prompt:**

```bash
pilot task -o component.html --code --snap "Write a Bootstrap5 component that looks like this."
```

**📊 Get an organized view of your Github issues:**

```bash
pilot task "Find all open Github issues labeled as 'bug', categorize and prioritize them"
```

**📝 Generate parts of your documentation with a [template](./prompts/README.md.jinja2):**

```bash
pilot task --direct -f prompts/README.md.jinja2 -o README.md
```

To learn more about templates, check out the [prompts](./prompts) directory.

**📝 Execute a step-by-step plan:**

Break down more complex tasks into smaller steps with a plan:

```yaml
# document_cli.yaml

name: Document the CLI
prompt: |
  The CLI is great, but we need a comprehensive user documentation.
  The documentation should be stored as Markdown files in the repository.

steps:
  - name: Identify documentation needs
    output_file: doc_instructions.md
    prompt: |
      1. Read `cli/cli.py`
      2. Identify the key features of the CLI and how it works
      3. List the documentation files that need to be created and outline their content
      4. Create step-by-step instructions for creating the documentation

  - name: Document the CLI
    template: doc_instructions.md
```

Run it with `pilot plan document_cli.yaml`.

### ⚙️ Options and Parameters

The CLI has global parameters and options that can be used to customize its behavior.


```bash
